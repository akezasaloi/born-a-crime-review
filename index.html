            <h1>An alien in my home</h1>
            <p>In this story, the main character "Trevor" is always judged by his neighbours and colleagues for being colored and not accepted 
                <br>as a black due to apartheid laws. This makes it hard for him to belong where he lives hence the title ‘An alien in my home’<br>
                    </p>

            <h2> “Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women…<br> He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”</h2>
            <p>Abel just like today's society expects women to be independent at a certain level
                and at the same time, <br>become submissive to their partners.
            A good example is in nowadays relationships where men <br>don't want to be asked
            to give the bare minimum even in courtship like pay bills on dates and still <br>
            expect women to respond to their every whim in an instant.
            They want women to work <br>and pay 50% of the family's expenses while 
            taking care of the children with all household duties on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the story Abel wants Patricia to act and live the way he wants because he believes
            that's the way it should be <br>in a marriage, relating it to the way his father treated 
            his mother and his grandfather before him.
            He desires to <br>manipulate Patricia so that he can take away her audacity and turn her into 
            a plain traditional wife<br> like the ones in his home place.
            Today's society also wants women to always give and follow the rules set by men<br>
            without question.
