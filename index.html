            <p>In this story, the main character "Trevor" is always judged by his neighbours and colleagues for being colored and not accepted 
                as a black due to apartheid laws. This makes it hard for him to belong where he lives hence the title ‘An alien in my home’</p>

        <h2>“Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 
            He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”</h2>
        <p> Abel just like today's society expects women to be independent at a certain level
            and at the same time, become submissive to their partners.
            A good example is in nowadays relationships where men don't want to be asked
            to give the bare minimum even in courtship like pay bills on dates and still 
            expect women to respond to their every whim in an instant.
            They want women to work and pay 50% of the family's expenses while 
            taking care of the children with all household duties on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the story Abel wants Patricia to act and live the way he wants because he believes
            that's the way it should be in a marriage, relating it to the way his father treated 
            his mother and his grandfather before him.
            He desires to manipulate Patricia so that he can take away her audacity and turn her into 
            a plain traditional wife like the ones in his home place.
            </p>
            <p>Today's society also wants women to always give and follow the rules set by men
            without question.
            Some men want to know where their female partners went and they put restrictions on who they talk to
            and who they meet.In some countries especially in Africa and Asia they don't even want them to learn
            because they know if women learn they will outsmart them and fight for their independence.
